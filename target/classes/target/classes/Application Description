MedTrack is a simple application designed to track the side-effects to different medication taken by the user.
The user is able to build a list of medications, medication formats and effects.  The medication need not only be pill format medications but can include natural medicines, oils, creams and other forms of medicine.  The medication product can be something that is taken recurrently or simply on occasion when required.  Based on the configured Medications & Effects the user can then register purchase events for the medication, log when they taken the medication, log any effects they experience that could be due to the medication and finally, see a history of the medication effects.  This can be useful information to provide to the care giver of the user.

The application is composed of 4 GUI forms:

1. Login Form : simply allows the user to login given the correct user and password.
2. ContactForm : Allows someone to communicate to the company by email and for that information to be saved in the app database.
3. SignupForm : If the user does not exist in the database, then they must signup to have access.  This form thus allows them to signup by entering very basic information.  They can further fill-in their profile information in the ProfileForm.
4. ProfileForm : This form is the most important in the application.  It is a main page with an accordion configuration which allows the user to access sub-sections or sub-modules to configure their information. These submodules are:

	A) Account - a simple panel where the user can update their account information.
	B)Configure Medication - Where the user can configure their medications by filling various information about them: BrandName, Generic Name, Format, Measurement Units, Active Ingredients.
	C) Configure Medication Effects - Add effects, be they positive or negative to a medication. They can give this effect a name, a description, the body location, etc.
	D)Add Medication Purchase - This essentially allows the user to enter information about the medication they just purchased, such as the date, the expiry date, the dosage, etc.  The user can choose if the app will notify them
When their medication expires.
	E) Log Medication Taken - Lets the user register an instance of taking a given medication.  This registers the date the medication was taken, the medication and the dosage - for example, the user may choose to log only one event for the day, even if they need to take two doses of the medication per day.
	F)Log Medication Effect : This allows the user to select a medication and an effect to be linked together, along with other information such as the date, the severity of the effect, duration time etc.  If the side-effects could be from a combination of medications, a side-effect - medication record must be created for each medication and side-effect (for now).  This could be simplified to a multi-select to allow the user t select  more than one side-effect per medication.
	G) Medication Effects History : This is a simple TableView allowing the user to see a history of the side-effects they have logged along with the medication they were taking.  This can allow the user to see side-effect patterns that might be occurring either with the types of medication, they could be initial side-effect and dissipate with time etc.
