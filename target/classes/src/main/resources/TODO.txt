- Display a message to the effect that the fields in red are required instead of saying
the fields are blank.

- load the background images in the fxml instead of dynamically.

dynamically or in SceneBuilder...should work as long as am not referring to any components that
haven't been initialized yet.

- integrate more functionality in the interface....
