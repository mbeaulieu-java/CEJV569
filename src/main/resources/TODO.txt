- Update MedTrack class documentation with new data about the interface data objects.
- Document all the data interfaces
- Display a message to the effect that the fields in red are required instead of saying
the fields are blank.

- create seperate .fxml files for each panel in the accordion, then either assign the controllers
dynamically or in SceneBuilder...should work as long as am not referring to any components that
haven't been initialized yet.
